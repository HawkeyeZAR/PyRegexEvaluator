This is a simple but handy python regular expression tester.
You just add your test data you want to search, and type in your regular expression.

It will then find your results, it makes testing and creating your patterns easier.

----------


How to use			
-------------------		

First paste in your test data, then enter your regex pattern to find and hit Enter.
Or you can just click on the find button

> **Note:**

> - It does two kind of searches, `re.finditer()` and `re.findall()`.
> - The highlighted matches belong too `re.finditer()` .
> - The text in the output textbox are the `re.findall()` results.


----------


There will be a slight variance between results. 
As search is using finditer and the other search is using findall.
